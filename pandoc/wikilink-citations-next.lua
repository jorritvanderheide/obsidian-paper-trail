--- Turn Obsidian wikilinks into pandoc citations: the next version.
---
--- Paper Trail writes a citation as `[[citekey]]` rather than `[@citekey]`.
--- That is a link, so inside the vault it resolves, opens the paper, previews
--- it on hover, and puts every use of a source into that source's backlinks,
--- which is the question a thesis asks of its own corpus. Outside the vault it
--- is not a citation yet. This is what makes it one.
---
--- This is a candidate to replace `wikilink-citations.lua`, which stays the
--- published filter until it does. It adds two things, see `todo.md`:
---
--- - A page after `#`: `[[key#p. 12]]` cites page 12, as `[@key, p. 12]`
---   would. Obsidian shows it as "key > p. 12" and it is still a link to the
---   paper, so it stays in the backlinks.
--- - Neighbouring citations share brackets: `[[a#p. 12]]; [[b#p. 3]]` is
---   "(A 2024, 12; B 2025, 3)", as `[@a, p. 12; @b, p. 3]` would be.
---
--- Usage, and the order matters:
---
---   pandoc chapter.md \
---     --from=markdown+wikilinks_title_after_pipe \
---     --lua-filter=pandoc/wikilink-citations-next.lua \
---     --bibliography=Literature/library.bib \
---     --citeproc \
---     --output=chapter.docx
---
--- `--from` because pandoc does not read `[[...]]` as anything at all without
--- it, and the filter would have nothing to work on. The filter before
--- `--citeproc` because pandoc runs them in the order you write them, and
--- citeproc can only resolve citations that already exist when it runs.

local keys = {}

--- Every entry key in a .bib file.
---
--- Read rather than guessed, and this is the whole of the filter's judgement.
--- Every wikilink in a vault is a link: to a paper, to a concept note, to
--- yesterday's daily note. Only the ones naming an entry in the bibliography
--- are citations. Without this check a link to your own writing would come out
--- as a citation to a work that does not exist, and citeproc would either drop
--- it or print a bracketed question mark into the middle of a sentence.
local function read_bib(path)
  local file = io.open(path, 'r')
  if not file then

--- The bibliographies pandoc was given, however they were given.
---
--- `--bibliography=x` sets this metadata field, and so does a `bibliography:`
--- line in the document's own front matter. Either can be one path or a list,
--- so both shapes are unwrapped here rather than at the call site.

--- The citation key a wikilink target names, or nil when it names none.
---
--- Obsidian writes the target three ways depending on a setting nobody

--- same paper, so all of them are the same citation.

--- Whether a link still means anything once the vault is behind you.
---
--- A scheme means something outside this document knows how to resolve it: a
--- reader can follow `https:`, and their machine can follow `zotero:`. A `#`
--- means somewhere in the exported document itself. Everything else points at a
--- file in the vault, which the export does not have and will never have.
local function reachable(target)

--- One link: a citation, a link, or the words it was made of.
---
--- `NormalCitation` rather than `AuthorInText`, because `[[key]]` stands in a
--- sentence where `[@key]` would, and nothing in the link says whether the
--- author was named in the prose. Anyone wanting "as Keshav (2007) argues" can
--- still write `@key` by hand; pandoc reads that already.
---
--- A link to one of your own notes is unwrapped rather than kept, because a
--- link is a promise that something is at the other end. In the vault there is.
--- In a Word file handed to a supervisor there is a dead reference to a path on
--- your laptop, and the reader finds that out by clicking it. The words stay,
--- which is all the sentence needed from it: whether that is the note's name or
--- a label you wrote, it is what you chose to have on the page.
--- Locator terms, so a heading reference is read as a page only when it is one:
--- `[[key#p. 12]]` cites page 12, `[[key#Claim]]` is just the paper's Claim heading.
